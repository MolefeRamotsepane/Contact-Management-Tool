"We need a simple Contact Management Tool for our small business.

Staff must be able to:

- Add new contacts
- View all contacts
- Search for contact by name
- Delete a contact

"The contacts must be saved so that when the program closes and reopens,
the data is still there"

--- My goal

Build a console-based contact Manager that:

- Uses a file like (contacts.json or contacts.txt) to store data
- Runs in a loop until user exits
- Handles invalid inputs properly
- Keeps data persistant which means saved even after the program closes
